# Gwion
gwion is a object-oriented programming language, aimed at making music

**strongly** inspired by [chuck](http://chuck.stanford.edu/), but adding a bunch *high-level* features:  
	  templates, first-class functions and more.  

:gift: a [plugin system](https://github.com/fennecdjay/Gwion-plug) makes it easily extendable

#### simple example code (hello_world.gw):

```cpp
// print hello world
<<<"Hello World">>>;
```
to run this, do

```sh
./gwion hello_world.gw
```
You want to know more? :smile: Look [here](https://fennecdjay.github.io/gwion/)
Still WIP :construction_worker: but a nice place to learn and [contribute](https://github.com/fennecdjay/gwion/issues)

#### build
just
```
make
```

> if you run into troubles, please look [here](https://github.com/fennecdjay/Gwion/blob/master/docs/Building.md) and read on.
